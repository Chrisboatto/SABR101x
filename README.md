**SABR 101x**



Sabermetrics 101 is a course is archived from Boston University offered on the edX platform. This course does an excellent job at teaching you the history of baseball, sabermetrics within baseball and the basics of statistical analysis. This was the initial course that got me interested in statistical analysis and is a great way for any young person interested in statistics in baseball.

I would highly recommend taking this course as it was informative and great experience for me!!!!



I intentionally left out Module 6 from my repository because I would like you to complete the last Module on your own!!



GO GET EM!!!!!
